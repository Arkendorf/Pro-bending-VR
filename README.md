# Pro-bending VR
Probending VR is based on the fictional sport of the same name from the TV show The Legend of Korra. In it, two opponents battle each other in an immersive arena, while spectators watch from the stands. Instead of fighting with weapons or fists, contestants use the power of the elements, flinging fireballs back and forth. When players wear down their enemyâ€™s defenses, they are declared the victor.
